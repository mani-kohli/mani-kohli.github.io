<p>Data science and analytics, software engineering, medical courses and psychology.

Diversity in experience has centered around my primary career goal, integration of technology leading towards innovation. This is why I felt a Master in Data Science was a natural complement towards my objectives and with my skills. Additionally, I have a particular interest with innovation within healthcare and medical sciences, which aligns with my scholastic and industrial experience as well.</p>

<p>During my time off, I enjoy many different activities. I love playing sports (especially hockey, tennis and golf) and I keep active by focussing on living a healthy lifestyle. I also enjoy casual evenings with family and friends and staying informed on current events.</p>
